        The animal in this site is the rabbit.Rabbit is familiar throughout the world. With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily lifeâ€”as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration.

          The rabbit is characterized by its shorter ears while hares are characterized by their longer ears.Rabbits' ears are an important structure to aid thermoregulation and detect predators due to how the outer, middle, and inner ear muscles coordinate with one another. The ear muscles also aid in maintaining balance and movement when fleeing predators.

          Rabbits are often used as a symbol of fertility or rebirth, and have long been associated with spring and Easter as the Easter Bunny. The species' role as a prey animal with few defenses evokes vulnerability and innocence, and in folklore and modern children's stories, rabbits often appear as sympathetic characters, able to connect easily with youth of all kinds.The rabbit is also known for its speed, agility, and endurance, symbolized  by the marketing icons the Energizer Bunny and the Duracell Bunny.
